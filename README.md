# Recipe Executor

A tool for executing recipe-like natural language instructions to generate and manipulate code and other files.

## Overview

The Recipe Executor is a flexible orchestration system that executes "recipes" - JSON-based definitions of sequential steps to perform tasks such as file reading, LLM-based content generation, and file writing. This project allows you to define complex workflows through simple recipe files.

## Key Components

- **Recipe Format**: JSON-based recipe definitions with steps
- **Step Types**: Various operations including file reading/writing, LLM generation, and sub-recipe execution
- **Context System**: Shared state for passing data between steps
- **Template Rendering**: Liquid templates for dynamic content generation

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Recommended installers:

- Linux: apt or your distribution's package manager
- macOS: [brew](https://brew.sh/)
- Windows: [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)

#### Development tools

The core dependencies you need to install are:

- `make` - for scripting installation steps of the various projects within this repo
- `uv` - for managing installed versions of `python` - for installing python dependencies

Linux:

    # make is installed by default on linux
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    pipx install uv

macOS:

    brew install make
    brew install uv

Windows:

    winget install ezwinports.make -e
    winget install astral-sh.uv  -e

### Setup Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the environment file and configure your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to add your OPENAI_API_KEY and other optional API keys
   ```
3. Run the setup command to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
5. Test the installation by running the example recipe:
   ```bash
   make recipe-executor-create
   ```

## Using the Makefile

The project includes several useful make commands:

- **`make`**: Sets up the virtual environment and installs all dependencies
- **`make recipe-executor-context`**: Builds AI context files for recipe executor development
- **`make recipe-executor-create`**: Generates recipe executor code from scratch using the recipe itself
- **`make recipe-executor-edit`**: Revises existing recipe executor code using recipes

## Running Recipes

Execute a recipe using the command line interface:

```bash
python recipe_executor/main.py path/to/your/recipe.json
```

You can also pass context variables:

```bash
python recipe_executor/main.py path/to/your/recipe.json --context key=value
```

## Project Structure

The project contains:

- **`recipe_executor/`**: Core implementation with modules for execution, context management, and steps
- **`recipes/`**: Recipe definition files that can be executed

## Building from Recipes

One of the most interesting aspects of this project is that it can generate its own code using recipes:

1. To generate the code from scratch:

   ```bash
   make recipe-executor-create
   ```

2. To edit/revise existing code:
   ```bash
   make recipe-executor-edit
   ```

This demonstrates the power of the Recipe Executor for code generation and maintenance tasks.
