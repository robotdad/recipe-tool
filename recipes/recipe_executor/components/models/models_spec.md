# Models Component Specification

## Purpose

The Models component defines the core data structures used throughout the Recipe Executor system. It provides Pydantic models for validating and structuring data, including recipe steps, and files.

## Core Requirements

- Define consistent data structures for files
- Provide configuration models for various step types
- Support recipe structure validation
- Leverage Pydantic for schema validation and documentation
- Include clear type hints and docstrings

## Implementation Considerations

- Use Pydantic `BaseModel` for all data structures
- Ensure all models are serializable to JSON
- Use type hints for all fields
- Keep models focused and minimal
- Provide sensible defaults where appropriate
- Use descriptive field names and docstrings
- Focus on essential fields without over-engineering
