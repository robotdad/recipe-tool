Each component should have a **name** and a **brief description** of its role/responsibilities. Ensure the components cover all major features and concerns from the requirements. The components should be well-scoped and modular (each responsible for a distinct part of the functionality or infrastructure). Aim for a set of components that an individual developer or AI could implement one by one.
