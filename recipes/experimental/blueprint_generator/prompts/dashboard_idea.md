# Data Analytics Dashboard Platform

I want to build a web-based data analytics dashboard platform that lets users connect to various data sources, create visualizations, and share interactive dashboards with their team.

## Key Features

- Data source connectors for databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), APIs, CSV/Excel files, and cloud storage
- Data transformation capabilities (filtering, aggregation, joining datasets)
- Visualization builder with multiple chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter, maps, tables)
- Dashboard layout editor with drag-and-drop components
- Real-time collaboration on dashboards
- User management with role-based access control
- Alerting system for monitoring metrics and sending notifications
- Scheduled report generation and distribution
- Dashboard sharing and embedding capabilities
- Version history and change tracking
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Considerations

- Modern web framework for frontend (React/Vue)
- Backend API service
- Authentication and authorization
- Scalable data processing engine
- Real-time updates using WebSockets
- Caching layer for performance
- Export functionality (PDF, PNG, CSV)

The system should be modular, extensible, and allow for future integration of machine learning capabilities for predictive analytics.
