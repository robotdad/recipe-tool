Purpose and Scope\n- Questions about the component's primary responsibility\n- Questions about boundaries and what's out of scope\n- Questions about the problem being solved\n\n2. Functional Requirements\n- Questions about specific capabilities needed\n- Questions about user/system interactions\n- Questions about expected inputs and outputs\n\n3. Technical Requirements\n- Questions about implementation constraints\n- Questions about performance requirements\n- Questions about security considerations\n\n4. Integration and Dependencies\n- Questions about how it interacts with other components\n- Questions about external dependencies\n- Questions about interface requirements\n\n5. Error Handling and Edge Cases\n- Questions about failure scenarios\n- Questions about edge cases\n- Questions about recovery mechanisms\n\nIn each category, provide 3-5 specific questions that would help improve the specification. Make the questions clear, specific, and directly relevant to the candidate specification. For each question, briefly explain why this information is important for implementation.",
