  "description": "Enhanced analysis of YouTube videos with granular fact-checking and multi-stage refinement using Bing search",
  "usage_notes": "This recipe analyzes YouTube videos by retrieving the transcript, generating targeted search queries, performing web searches with Bing, and creating an engaging, accurate analysis.\n\nKey features:\n- Content-first approach: presents video content fairly before any critical analysis\n- Full content retrieval: Bing MCP automatically retrieves and analyzes complete articles\n- Temporal awareness: specifically targets current (2025) information and highlights temporal mismatches\n- Authoritative context analysis: analyzes provided trusted information to determine research needs\n- Smart query generation: focuses on information gaps not covered by authoritative context\n- Research prioritization: intelligently balances authoritative context with web research\n\nAI Context Workflow:\n1. Provide facts file with `ai_context` parameter\n2. Recipe analyzes fact file to extract established facts and information gaps\n3. Search queries prioritize topics not already covered in provided facts\n4. Web research fills gaps while authoritative context takes precedence on conflicts\n5. Final analysis seamlessly integrates both authoritative facts and web research\n\nDependencies:\n- mcp-server-bing-search: Install with `pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/semanticworkbench.git#subdirectory=mcp-servers/mcp-server-bing-search`\n- Bing API key for search functionality\n\nOptional parameters:\n- ai_context: Path to a file containing authoritative information that will override conflicting web results\n- model: The LLM model to use (default: openai/gpt-4o)\n\nOutput files:\n- content_draft.md: Initial analysis draft\n- content_critique.md: Editorial feedback on the draft\n- content_final.md: Polished final analysis\n- diagnostic_report.md: Detailed methodology and research process documentation\n- raw_research_data.md: Complete research data including snippets and full content\n\nExample usage:\nrecipe-tool --execute recipes/ytsummary/generate_ytanalysis_bing.json model=azure/o4-mini bing_api_key=XXX yturl=XXX ai_context=/path/to/facts.md",

Include specific names, numbers, and details that will produce precise search results\n4. Add contextual keywords that distinguish between similar events/policies from different periods\n5. When referring to specific people, include their current role (\"CEO Satya Nadella 2025\")\n\nEvery query MUST have a year specified. Queries without explicit temporal markers will receive mixed results from different time periods.\n\nMake each query specific, concise, and focused on a single verifiable claim or topic.
