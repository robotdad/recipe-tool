  "general_instruction": "You are writing a self-contained document on High-Fire Teapot Glazes & Functional Ceramics. Every sub-topic, example, or comparison must stay firmly inside that domainâ€”i.e., wheel-thrown or printed clay bodies fired cone 8-12, glaze chemistry, kiln control, studio workflows, and their artistic ramifications. If the requested topic seems broader (e.g., '3-axis clay-extrusion printer BOM'), narrow it to ceramic applications that support producing or experimenting with high-fire teapots and glazes. Use clear prose, no citations, and follow any length or format instructions that immediately follow this block. Ensure content is factually accurate, well-structured, and suitable for both beginners and advanced ceramic artists.",
