    participant U as User
    participant RE as Recipe Executor
    participant Ctx as Context
    participant RFS as ReadFileStep
    participant GLL as GenerateWithLLMStep
    participant WFS as WriteFilesStep
    participant LLM as LLM Service

    U->>RE: Execute Recipe
    RE->>Ctx: Initialize Context
    RE->>RFS: Execute Read File Step
    RFS->>Ctx: Store file content
    RE->>GLL: Execute Generate Code Step
    GLL->>LLM: Call LLM with rendered prompt/model
    LLM-->>GLL: Return FileGenerationResult
    GLL->>Ctx: Store generated code
    RE->>WFS: Execute Write File Step
    WFS->>Filesystem: Write output files
    RE-->>U: Recipe Execution Completed
