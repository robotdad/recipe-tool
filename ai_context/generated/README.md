# AI Context Files

These files are generated by running the `build_ai_context_files.py` script. They provide convenient context for sharing with LLMs. To generate these files, run the script from the repository root:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository root
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Run the script to generate AI context files
make ai-context-files
```

Rebuild these files whenever you make significant changes to the project recipes, specs and/or docs. This ensures that the AI context remains up-to-date and relevant for users interacting with the system.
