## Recent Updates

The app has been recently updated with:

1. Better API endpoint naming and dictionary return values
2. Improved context variable handling
3. Enhanced debugging features
4. More robust recipe format handling
5. New utility functions for common operations
6. Simplified error handling with decorators
7. Improved path resolution and file finding
8. Direct use of async functions with Gradio

See the [Implementation Report](implementation_report.md) for a comprehensive overview of recent improvements and the [Current Work Status](current_work.md) document for details on ongoing work and known issues.

## Code Organization

The app follows a modular design with these main components:

1. `app.py`: The main application with the Gradio UI and core functionality
2. `config.py`: Application configuration using Pydantic settings
3. `utils.py`: Utility functions for common operations (context preparation, path handling, etc.)

## Philosophy

The code follows these key principles:

1. **Ruthless Simplicity**: Keep everything as simple as possible
2. **Minimal Abstractions**: Every layer of abstraction must justify its existence
3. **Direct Integration**: Avoid unnecessary adapter layers
4. **End-to-End Thinking**: Focus on complete flows rather than perfect components
5. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Favor readable, straightforward code

See the [Implementation Report](implementation_report.md) for details on how these principles are applied.

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with the Recipe Tool app:

1. Check the [Debugging Guide](debugging.md) for common problems and solutions
2. Look for relevant [Technical Notes](technical_notes/README.md) that might explain the behavior
3. Examine the app logs for detailed error information
